# ai-accounting-research
A collection of papers, articles and code relation to AI and its impact on financial accounting, management accounting and financial reporting.

This is an ongoing project that will involve adding to a comprehensive repository where I wil explore how AI will impact the field of finance, targeting financial accounting, management accounting and financial reporting. The hope is that this will serve as place to showcase my arears of interest, and highlight my favourite research.

## Focus Areas

This repository covers the convergence of AI technologies with:
- **Financial Accounting**: Automated transaction processing, journal entries, and account reconciliation
- **Management Accounting**: Variance analysis, cost analysis, and performance measurement
- **Financial Reporting**: Automated report generation, disclosure analysis, and regulatory compliance
- **Auditing**: AI-assisted audit procedures, anomaly detection, and auditing reporting

## Purpose

The goal is to curate research, tools, case studies, and practical insights that demonstrate how machine learning, natural language processing, and other AI technologies are reshaping accounting as a profession and how decisions based on the work done by accountants have, and will be impacted.
